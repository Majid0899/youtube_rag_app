# youtube_rag_app
This project is a Full Stack GenAI application that allows users to query YouTube videos using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  The system extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, creates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and uses an LLM to generate contextual answers.
